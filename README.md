# Contagion-Simulation-Project

This project is inspired by the Washington Post’s article (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) that simulated infectiousness with 2D cells in a graphical visualization. 

In the simulation, 2D cells are in one of three state: vulnerable (grey), infected (red), or immuned (blue). As the cells move around, if a vulnerable cell comes into contacts with a infected cell, they become infected. After the recovery period is over, that cell then becomes immuned. The simulation ends no cells are infected.

To simulate differnt situations, varibles can be changed. Such as:
1. The total number of cells
2. The number of cells that start in each state at the beginning of the simulation
3. The recovery period time
4. The size of the cell
5. The speed of the cells
6. The bounds for the width and height that the simulation takes place in
